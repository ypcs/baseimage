Misc scripts for building Docker images

## Debian images
This assumes that your build host is Debian, and you've installed docker.io package.

### Build images
This creates Docker images and also exports them as `.tar` archives

    sudo make <wheezy|jessie|stretch|sid>

Images are also imported into Docker, by default with namespace `ypcs/{debian,ubuntu}:{codename}`
