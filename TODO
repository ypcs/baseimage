Initial issue:
 - build reproducible and minimal OS images for multiple purposes
  - base image for installing new host
  - docker base image
  - vagrant base images
  - virtual machine base images
  - base images for different cloud providers
 
 - support multiple distributions and releases
  - Debian: 8+
  - Ubuntu: 16.04+
  - ...
 - depend on other tools as much as possible, just provide configuration in
   easy format
 
 - goal: we can easily compare all images to Debian/Ubuntu archive and ensure that
   everything originates from upstream repository
 - goal: make it possible to build different flavours from single source
 - goal: cache as much as possible and reuse single source => minimize network usage

- instead of signing eg. *.xz files, sign *.tar to make signatures independed from compression algo
- use guestfish to modify/create disk image



- different architectures, eg. armhf + amd64 + i386
 - different formats: chroot only, image (bios), image (efi), image (secure boot)
 - different platforms: baremetal, docker, virtualbox, qemu, aws-ec2, upcloud, ...

- add helper like "docker-dev" that executes apt-setup and other essential commands to prepopulate cache, maybe install some helper tools like nano
